    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>The main objective of this tutorial is to estimate baseflow from an observed hydrograph at a river location so that direct (surface) runoff resulting from the excess rainfall can be separated. In case of a perennial or continuous flow regime (characteristic of humid climate), a nearly non varying flow occurs even in a rainless period of the year. This delayed flow occurs due to the infiltrated water from a previous rainfall event in the watershed eventually making its way to the river through subsurface flow and seepage through the channel bed. In order to study the effect of a current rainfall event, the baseflow component has to be separated from the total flow and direct runoff (total flow minus baseflow) has to be calculated. A typical runoff hydrograph representing the surface runoff and baseflow is shown below along with the associated rainfall and excess rainfall (effective rainfall).</p> \n",

    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>There are various methods developed to separate the baseflow from the total streamflow. The ground water can make up the substantial portion in a streamflow and its contribution must be evaluated.</p>\n",

    "    <li><span style=\"color:red\">Eckhardt (2005)</span></li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>The <i>first method</i> used in this tutorial (Arnold et al (1995)) uses digital filter technique which was originally used in signal analysis and processing. The equation of the filter is given by:</p>\n",
    "$$q_t = \\beta  q_{t-1} + (1+\\beta)/2 \\times(Q_t - Q_{t-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>$q_t$ - filtered surface runoff (quick response) at the t time step (one day)</li>\n",
    "    <li>Q - original streamflow</li>\n",
    "    <li>$\\beta$ - filter parameter (0.925)</li>\n",
    "    \n",
    "The baseflow $b_t$ is given by:\n",
    "$$b_t = Q_t - q_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: left;'>In this method, filters are passed over the streamflow data three times (forward, backward and forward) depending upon the the user's selected estimates of baseflow. The consequence of each pass is that it will reduce the baseflow as a percentage of total flow.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: left;'>The second method used in the tutorial is proposed by Eckhardt (2005). It is considered as a special separtion technique which involves recursive digital filtering of hydrographs. This method is centered on simple one-parameter filter ($\\alpha$ is the parameter). The partitions the streamflow into two components, namely direct runoff and baseflow and is represented by:</p>\n",
    "$$y_k = f_k + b_k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>y - total streamflow</li>\n",
    "    <li>f - direct runoff</li>\n",
    "    <li>b - baseflow</li>\n",
    "    <li>k - time step number</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "The general form is expressed in terms of one parameter filter($\\alpha$) and $BFI_{max}$. It is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$b_k = \\frac{(1 - BFI_{max}) \\times \\alpha \\times b_{k-1} + (1-\\alpha) \\times BFI_{max}\\times y_k}{1 - \\alpha \\times BFI_{max}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\alpha$ varies between 0 and 1. $BFI_{max}$ which is the maximum value of baseflow index (long-term ratio of baseflow to total streamflow) is always less than 1. In this tutorial, we will consider $\\alpha$ as 0.98 and $BFI_{max}$ as 0.8."
